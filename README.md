# Vidar.js
> A video editor for developers

![Screenshot](screenshots/2019-08-17_0.png)

Vidar.js is an in-browser video-editing framework. Similar to video-editing software, it lets you layer media and other content on a timeline. Audio, image, video and other tracks are supported, along with powerful video and audio manipulation to existing tracks.

Some things you can do with this framework are making a video-editor with a UI, making a machine-generated video, or just having fun mixing videos. Being very flexible and extendable, you can choose to only use the core components or define your own.

## Installation

Use [one of the bundled files](dist).

## Usage

```html
<script src="vidar-iife.js"></script>
```

or

```js
import vd from 'vidar-esm.js';
```

Then, to create a movie (which is a project)
```js
const movie = new vd.Movie(canvas);
```

Then, add layers
```js
movie
  // add an empty blue layer starting at 0s and lasting 3s and filling the entire screen
  .addLayer(new vd.layer.Base(0, 3, {background: 'blue'}))
  // add a cropped video layer starting at 2.5s
  .addLayer(new vd.layer.Video(2.5, video, {mediaX: 10, mediaY: -25}));
```

To start the movie, just like any ol' `<video>` or `<audio>`, use `.play()`
```js
movie.play();
```
